# Clima Weather App

## Overview

Welcome to the Clima Weather App project! This project showcases the implementation of various advanced concepts in Swift, including networking with APIs, the use of Core Location, and the development of a dark-mode enabled user interface. The goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of these concepts and demonstrate their application in a practical, functional application.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to:

- Introduce and work with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to fetch live data.
- Develop a dark-mode enabled app.
- Utilize Core Location to get GPS data from the iPhone.
- Implement the delegate pattern and Swift protocols.
- Solidify knowledge of asynchronous programming and JSON parsing.

## What I Created

In this project, I developed a functional weather app. This app allows users to check the weather for their current location based on the GPS data from their iPhone, as well as by searching for a city manually. The app supports dark mode for a better user experience in low-light environments.

## Learning Outcomes

### Dark-Mode Enabled App

- Created an application with support for dark mode, enhancing user experience in various lighting conditions.

### Using Vector Images as Image Assets

- Utilized vector images to ensure high-quality, scalable graphics for multiple screen sizes and resolutions.

### UITextField for User Input

- Implemented `UITextField` to allow users to input city names for weather searches.

### Delegate Pattern and Swift Protocols

- Applied the delegate pattern to handle text field events and Core Location updates.
- Defined and used Swift protocols to create reusable and flexible code components.

### Swift Guard Keyword and Computed Properties

- Used the `guard` keyword to write safer and more readable code.
- Implemented computed properties to dynamically calculate values based on other properties.

### Swift Closures and Completion Handlers

- Used closures and completion handlers to manage asynchronous tasks, such as network requests.

### Networking with URLSession

- Implemented `URLSession` to perform HTTP requests and fetch weather data from an API.

### Parsing JSON with Encodable and Decodable Protocols

- Parsed JSON data using Swift's native `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols, converting JSON responses into Swift objects.

### Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)

- Used Grand Central Dispatch to manage concurrent tasks and update the UI on the main thread.

### Core Location

- Utilized Core Location to get the current location from the iPhone's GPS, handling permissions and retrieving coordinates.

## Getting Started

To explore this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Review the implementation to understand how each feature was built.
4. Run the application on the iOS Simulator or an iOS device to test its functionality.

## Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive understanding of networking with APIs, the delegate pattern, and asynchronous programming in Swift. The resulting weather app showcases the practical application of these concepts, highlighting the learning and coding skills involved in its creation.
